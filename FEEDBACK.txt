Hi! Good work so far. Here is some feedback:

-Please try to submit things in individual folders, rather than new repositories.
 You should only have one respository called CS5003-Spring2020 or something similar,
 and inside that have your folders with Lab/Assignments names and files inside those.
 Let me know if you need help creating a new folder in GitHub.
 
-On Lab4 (encrypt) make sure you pay attention to where your lines start and the spacing.
 For example, here:
  if not (0 < shift_amount < CHARACTERS_IN_ALPHABET):
        shift_amount = 1
        encrypttext = ""

        for c in plaintext:
            encrypttext += chr((ord(c) - 97 + shift_amount) % 26 + 97)

        return encrypttext
 Make sure that encrypttext = "" and everything under is not tabbed (aka it starts all the way at the beginning).
 The same goes for the decrypt function. Right now, it doesn't run properly because the entire function is under the
 if statement, but you only want "shift_amount = 1" to be inside the if statement.
 
-For Lab 5, I only see the copying a file part, not the encrypting and decrypting portion. If you have this, make sure
 to submit it, preferably all in the same folder!
 
-There is a small typo in your Lab 6 range() function. Says Life off instead of Lift off. Not a big deal but pay attention 
 because typos can cause major headaches in other scenarios!
 
-For Q15 finding_distance.py in Midterm (and in general) it's usually better to add a space at the end when asking for an input.
 It will look better when a user in inputting (will look like Question? Answer instead of Question?Answer) but not a huge deal!
 Also, you don't need to do print(main()), just main() if your main function is already printing something. You only need to do 
 print(main()) if the function returns a value you want to print but doesn't print on it's own.
 
Overall great job!
